Key Sales Insights-

1. Top-Selling Product by Revenue:

Apple generated the highest revenue: $30.00.

This suggests Apple is either the most popular product or has a higher price per unit.

2. Equal Quantity, Unequal Revenue:

Apple and Banana both sold 25 units, but:

Apple’s revenue is $30.00

Banana’s revenue is only $12.50

This shows pricing has a big impact on total revenue — even with the same sales volume.

3. Underperforming Product:

Orange sold only 8 units, generating just $6.40 in revenue.

This may indicate lower demand, limited stock, or the need for promotional efforts.

4. Revenue Distribution:

Revenue isn't equally distributed — Apple dominates the chart, while Orange contributes minimally.

This can help in inventory planning and marketing focus.
